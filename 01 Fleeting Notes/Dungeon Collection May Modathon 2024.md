## Prompt

> I wanted to formally invite you to contribute to a mod I’m designing for the next *Modathon*. It’ll be called **Dungeon Collection for Modders** and the idea is to offer a series of small dungeons using only vanilla assets, made by a small group of established modders I’m inviting to contribute to the main collection I’ll be offering. On the one hand, it’s a fun challenge to push our creative boundaries and see how far we can take things just with vanilla assets (I’m also aiming for the vanilla-only achievement with this mod). The main goal, though, is to offer a head start for those that may want to mod but feel intimidated with the dungeon design part.

> They will be able to use the dungeons in their own mods, modifying / increasing them as they see fit. You don’t have to contribute more than one, it can be small, and it can be absolutely anything you want. Also, it doesn’t have to that polished/finished (not even "complete", because it'll be an isolated showcase), the main point is to use them also as dungeon-design “lessons” (I’ll add Books with tips and explaining some concepts/layouts present in each dungeon).
