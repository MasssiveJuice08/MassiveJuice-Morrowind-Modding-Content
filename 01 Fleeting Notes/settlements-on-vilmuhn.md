## Present Settlement of Vilmuhn

- Closest settlement is Nivalis. Worth checking what the demographics are and how Nordic it is.
	- If a current setttlement exists on the island, it is possible that an Imperial Legion or Navy runaway could join the island. If not joining the settlement, they could perhaps join the reavers who prowl the eastern shore.
- Next closest settlement is Dagon Fel. It's not unreasonable there could be a small Nordic fishing village there.
- If no present settlement, why? Something must have made the island habitable and able to sustain a modest population previously. Did this change at some point in the past, making settlement no longer desirable or Impractical?

## History of Settlement on Vilmuhn

- previously inhabited concurrently by Dwemer and Nords at different times. Sometimes dwelling alongside each other in peace, and other times coming into conflict with one another 
	- External politics of wider Morrowind could have caused such conflicts, such as the Nordic invasion of Morrowind. 
	- What local factors could cause competition and outright conflict between the two peoples on the island proper? Competition over resources? Religious conflict? 
		- Dwemer disruption of the ecosystem to fuel their energy demands, such as disrupting water flow?
		- Nordic Dragon Cult activity causing religious conflict?
- The Dwemer settlement likely collapsed due to the disappearance of the Dwemer. The Nordic Dragon Cult Temple was abandoned at a later point, though the reasons for this are not yet established.
- Possible Dunmer presence? Unlikely, at least during the time of concurrent Dwemer and Nordic settlement as the island would not be able to support a larger population of more competing groups of peoples. Perhaps later settlement is possible.
	- If not outright settlement, there could be reference to Tribunal Temple activity on the island. Perhaps the actions of a Saint, whose actions caused the Temple at one point to place a shrine on the island
