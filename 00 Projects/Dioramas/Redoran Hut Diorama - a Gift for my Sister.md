## On Discovering Morrowind

## My First Diorama

This was my first diorama. Previously I had only worked with scale miniatures, painting my [Warhammer 40,000 'Word Bearers'](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTbKT9UhZJY/?igsh=MTRqcjZ6OHRrMWE0bw==) I'd found the works of [Deloto](https://www.instagram.com/deloto51?igsh=OHJiZTF1aWRpdm5t) online and had the idea of making a diorama for my sister's birthday. As well as selling me a [Redoran Hut](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVocdiBcFd/?igsh=MXA3cnZxYnUzOG5zbg==) and some Ashlands flora sculptures, they were kind enough to throw in a few spares as well when I reached out to them.

### Assembling the Diorama

I wanted to paint the sculptures myself so I'd asked Deloto for just the plain sculptures. Using a large round Games Workshop base, I started by sculpting the landscape using Milliput and gluing the hut, urns, scathecraw and trama root down. I applied some fine gravel and sand with PVA, then primed it all with Citadel 'Wraithbone' spray.

### Painting

To get the colours right, I used Remiros' [Intelligent Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47469) as the basis and assembled the texture images into a gallery to act as my [[Ald-Ruhn Colour-Palette]].

I really love [Citadel 'Constrast Paints'](https://citadelcolour.com/videos/contrast-paints/) (though I've yet to try their derivatives, such as [Army Painter's 'Speed Paints'](https://thearmypainter.com/collections/speedpaint)) as a way for quickly building up shadows and highlights. They are incredibly versatile Paints â€“ when thinned down extensively with medium, they act as fantastic glazes and filters, making for smooth colour transitions. I applied multiple glazes of thinned down 'Skeleton Horde' Contrast Paint to add depth and smooth colour transition to the hut. To get the textured, worn, carapace-like appearance of the hut I stippled highlights on, and added darker shadows using 'Cygor Brown' to create pock-marked recesses in the stone.

For the ashlandic landscape, I wanted to capture the red and purple undertones. At first glance the ashlands just appear, well, grey, but there's more to it than that. Even in-game, the ash-storms that billow from Red Mountain are an ochre colour. Over the wraithbone basecoat, I selectively applied heavily diluted washes of red and purple contrast paints to parts where I'd made the glued sand finer. Once applied, I would rinse my brush and, leaving a bit of water on the brush, then featherd out the edges to create a smooth blend so the red and purple did not appear to be 'blotches' of colour. 

Over the top of the undertones I drybrushed multiple layers of grey, working up to lighter shades for the most raised surfaces. In-between I applied diluted washes of black and dark-brown. It was easy to lose the red and purple undertones during this, so I had to re-do them a couple of times.
