## Effective Page Layout Design

### How Readers Scan Web Content

The [Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g)](https://www.nngroup.com/) identified four common patterns that readers follow to scan a page:

> [!columns|clean no-t flex 2] Column Container
> > [!info|no-i title-center] F-Pattern
> > Users scan in the shape of a letter F, reading earlier sentences more fully and then only scanning the beginning of lines as they move further down the page.
>
> > [!info|no-i title-center c-green] Layer cake pattern
> > Users scan by reading the headings of a page first to determine which sections (if any) they want to read.
> 
> > [!info|no-i title-center c-orange] Spotted pattern
> > Users scan the page more sporadically, paying attention to text that particularly stands out, such as bolded fonts, text in a different color, or sidebars.
>
> > [!info|no-i title-center c-purple] Commitment pattern
> > Users scan to find the areas of the article they are especially interested in, which they then read more fully.

Users can unconsciously prefer one scanning style, or will switch between styles depending on the type of tasks they are performing. 

It is not a random act, however, and article layout can be optimised to best suit each of these scanning styles.[^1]

### F-Pattern

- Make sentence openers catchy, concise and informative.
	- Put the perfect number of keywords at the beginning of lines so readers can quickly understand what the following lines will be about.
- Use a 1:3:1 writing rhythm
- Use an optimal column width of 66-75 characters.

### Layer-Cake Pattern

- Headers should clearly identify section content in a way that can be understood on its own without context, whilst also building off previous heading subject-matter in a logical progression
- Headings should follow a standard, predictable pattern, e.g., 'introduction', 'key points', 'conclusion'.
	- Creativity is layered on top of the basic structure to increase readability of the sections, e.g., lists, quotes, images, diagrams.

### Spotted Pattern

Drawing attention to important elements within sections helps to accommodate the _Spotted Pattern_.

Things that can pop out include:
- Bold words
- Text colored differently from the main body text (including links).
- Number written as numerals (1, 2, 3)
- Text in quotation marks
- Bulleted lists
- Callouts
- Blockquotes.

The content of these elements, when attention is drawn to them, should serve to support the logical progression of the article - the should be relevant to their section heading.

### Links

A link text should explain clearly what information the reader will get by clicking on that link.[^2]

Links serve to give readers a sense of what a section of text is about and can be written in such a way as to enhance the Spotted Pattern style.

Ensure at least some of a link highlights a relevant point to the paragraph as a whole. For example:

> [!columns|2 no-t flex]
> > [!quote] UESP, ['Morrowind:Canctunian Ponius'](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Canctunian_Ponius)
> > _"Aside from his natural [charm](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Voice_of_the_Emperor "Morrowind:Voice of the Emperor") and ability to [absorb fatigue from others](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Star_of_the_West "Morrowind:Star of the West"), he knows no spells."_
> 
> > [!note|clean no-t]
> > - The link to the power 'Star of the West' is aliased as "ability to [absorb fatigue from others](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Star_of_the_West "Morrowind:Star of the West")"
