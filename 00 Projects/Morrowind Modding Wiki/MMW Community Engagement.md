## Intro

An inviting and intriguing community is more likely to garner interest and engagement. Fostering this community could encourage more users to contribute content to the Morrowind Modding Wiki, something which will always be an uphill struggle as modders tend to prefer _creating_ game content over _documenting_ it. 

## Community Engagement Ideas

- **Featured Articles on the homepage**, similar to Wikipedia and other wikis
	- Periodic featured articles (e.g., monthly) showcasing quality content.
	- [[Wikipedia-Did you know - Wikipedia|'Did you know']] section showcasing factoid snippets from new and improved articles.
- **Writing competitions**
- ?
