I'm pretty certain it would be a big commitment. You might possibly commit to the dialogue/questwriting for one part of it, but it is a lot

## Dwemer Ruins - Main Quest

The **main quest** involves exploring the Dwemer ruins with the Imperial Archaeological Society:
- Exploration is done in stages, as you bring different parts of the Dwemer complex 'back online' in order to reach the next area.
    - There would be downtime between unlocking each new area, as the expedition members repair and excavate new areas.
    - Inspired by the principles of Rubberman's [Dwemer Rebirth Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45249), I want the Dwemer ruins to follow a logical structure that reflects IRL steam-power systems and engineering principles. My brother-in-law is an engineer nerd with a degree in mechatronics (whatever that is lol) who helps run the local power grid, so at least I have a good reference for getting that right
        - Unlocking each area would involve bringing different parts of the steam-powwered system online.
- The **"Big Bad" is ( ??? )** - I don't know anymore. Original idea was a Dwemer 'lich', or otherwise a dwarf who somehow survived the disappearance of the Dwemer, and has nefarious, perhaps crazed or corrupted motives.
    - Perhaps the "villain" or obstacle is not an individual, but rather the ruins themselves. 
        - Perhaps in unlocking the ruins, the expedition team disrupts the delicate, dormant systems, threatening some kind of environmental or metaphysical catastrophe

## Nordic Ruins

In addition to the Dwemer ruins, there remains a number of ancient **Nordic ruins**, particularly an old **Dragon Cult** temple.
- relevance to the main quest is debatable; exploration is perhaps more appropriate as a side quest
- the island's history is marked by settlement of Dwemer and Nords, sometimes allied, sometimes opposed.
    - At some point after the disappearance of the Dwemer, settlement on the island became either inhospitable (disappearance of the Dwemer could have meant a weather machine controlling the climate fell into disrepair?) or unprofitable for the Nords (raw material wealth dried up - perhaps rare minerals on the islane were the original incentive for Dwemer/Nordic settlement). 
        - Perhaps a small Nordic fishing village remains, occasionally harbouring Imperial Navy/Legion deserters from nearby Nivalis, and with connections to Dagon Fel

## Elsewhere on the island:

- A band of smugglers/reavers are based on the eastern coast, out of sight of Imperial Navy patrols from Nivalis. Among this band could be Imperial Navy deserters.
    - Imperial Navy in Nivalis could offer a bounty to bring the reavers to justice
    - **Main Quest relevance:**They may have previously plundered parts of the Dwemer ruins, taking parts necessary to bring the ruins back online.
    - They may hold the importance of a **faction** in the main quest with motives in their own right. You could serve their ends covertly while working with the expedition to unlock the ruins.

- An old hermit lives on the island. Perhaps they are a grizzled old Nord who maintains the ruins of the Dragon Cult temple. They might offer a fetch quest or two, perhaps to collect the **Glowing Muscaria** from OAAB which grow throughout the island

Before bringing others on, I'll be writing up a lore and development/style guideline
