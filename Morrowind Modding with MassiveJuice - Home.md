## Welcome! 

![[Profile_Picture.jpg|profile left htiny wtiny]]

Kia ora, I'm **MassiveJuice**!

I make Morrowind mods and one day I hope to actually finish one of them. You can follow along here for updates on my various projects and see details of my research and creative process.

## Who is Rupert?

![[Rupert_Profile.png|profile right htiny wtiny]]

He's our cat. Or rather, I'm his human. The running joke (it's not a joke, I'm dead serious, this is 100% fact) is that Rupert is the true author of all my Morrowind mods and I, as the human with opposable thumbs, merely press the keys for him. 

Rupert is my number one obsession. I'm his biggest fan. He is 'da boy', 'he who hungers for bikkies', 'da fuzzy baby', and sometimes he can even be found actually awake (but mostly he slumbers, dreaming of Morrowind mods and fooooood).

### Here's what other modders have to say about Rupert:
