## 'Tagging Pages for Problems' page

- [x] See [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tagging_pages_for_problems)

> "Tags" are often used to indicate problems. Some [Wikipedia editors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians "Wikipedia:Wikipedians") object to the practice of tagging instead of fixing, but there is value in pointing out an article's problems. Tagging allows editors to specialize, teaches editors and warns readers about subpar or problematic content. It is better if people solve the problems they encounter themselves, but not everyone may be able to.

### To-Do:

- [x] [[MMW Inline Cleanup Tags|Inline Cleanup Tags]]
	- [ ] Elaborate: make the tags link to their description, not to the template.
- [x] Maintenance Templates
- [x] hide 'Templates' folder from [Explorer](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/explorer)

## [Article Layout Guidelines](https://morrowind-modding.github.io/MMW-Design--and--Planning/Manual-of-Style---36-Sermons-of-MMW/Article-Layout-Guidelines)

- [ ] use frontmatter `parent:` to backlink to a parent article in a series of articles? Is it redundant?

## Referencing Sources

- [ ] Settle on a referencing style, like Chicago

## Glossary

How to handle all these acronyms and terms? There's linking to the relevant page of course... that's how most wikis do it. Is there room for a glossary?

- maybe just a glossary of acronyms

## Editing and Ownership Permissions:

- forking is an extra hurdle to contributing
- Adding too many 'owners' to the github organization presents a security risk
- Guidelines for becoming an owner
- Can we utilize Github Teams roles to make it easier for contributers, whilst maintaining the security of the repo and the organization as a whole?

## Disambiguation Pages

Investigate how Wikipedia uses these. This may become a useful tool once there is significantly more wiki content.

## Infobox and Navbox

- [ ] Consider creating clear distinction between Infoboxes and [Navboxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Navigation_template)
- [ ] infobox and other float callouts using headings... this breaks the consecutive flow of h1-h6. Check how Wikipedia implements infoboxes
	- Wikipedia infoboxes are entirely comprised of HTML tables. Headers are `<th>`. Many if not all TH's appear to have `colspan="2"` For MMW, perhaps utilizing **bold** for headers is best, with table headers otherwise serving as section headers within an infobox.

## SEO

- [ ] Add analytics
- [ ] add trending/featured/completed articles (present users with content up-front)
- [x] check if logo has alt text
- [ ] Register for Google Search Console
- [ ] Redesign homepage to increase click-through rate
