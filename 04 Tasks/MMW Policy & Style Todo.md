## 'Tagging Pages for Problems' page

See [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tagging_pages_for_problems)

> "Tags" are often used to indicate problems. Some [Wikipedia editors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians "Wikipedia:Wikipedians") object to the practice of tagging instead of fixing, but there is value in pointing out an article's problems. Tagging allows editors to specialize, teaches editors and warns readers about subpar or problematic content. It is better if people solve the problems they encounter themselves, but not everyone may be able to.
