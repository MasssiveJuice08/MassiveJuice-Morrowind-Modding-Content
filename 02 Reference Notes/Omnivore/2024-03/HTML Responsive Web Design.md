## Highlights

> ## Media Queries
> 
> In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries in responsive web pages.
> 
> With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes.
> 
> Example: resize the browser window to see that the three div elements below will display horizontally on large screens and stack vertically on small screens: [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/html-responsive-web-design-18e8e459fc7#e53a38da-5786-4cdc-bfd3-d0d320cb329f)  ^e53a38da

A media query can add a "breakpoint" for `div` containers (which I think Callouts are...), where if the `screen` is e.g. 800px or smaller it sets `width: 100%`, meaning multiple div containers floating side by side will now stack one on top of the other as they expand to 100% width of the screen.
