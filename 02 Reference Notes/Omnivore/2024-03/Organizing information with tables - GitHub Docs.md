## Organizing information with tables - GitHub Docs
#Omnivore

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/https-docs-github-com-en-get-started-writing-on-github-working-w-18e4588872d)
[Read Original](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables)

### Highlights

> You can align text to the left, right, or center of a column by including colons `:` to the left, right, or on both sides of the hyphens within the header row.

See: [[Temporary solution to fix tables]]

Text alignment can be adjusted, but need to investigate adjusting text size with HTML tags.
