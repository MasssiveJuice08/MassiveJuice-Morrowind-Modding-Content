> 
> This docker image allows you to run [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) in docker as a container and access it via your web browser.
> 
> Use `http://localhost:8080/` to access it locally, do not expose this to the web unless you secure it and know what you are doing!! [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-github-com-sytone-obsidian-remote-blob-main-readme-md-18e4eaa0585#f48730c3-dfb7-4b23-99fd-0692fad66fd2)  ^f48730c3
