How to create a docs site for your project with Bulma Clean Theme

_This page is powered by [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app) ‐ you can read more about how I use Omnivore here: [[Omnivore - Saving Articles for Citations in Obsidian]]._

### Highlights

[Bulma Clean Theme](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/bulma-clean-theme/) is a free [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site theme that is capable of handling docs sites, i.e., a wiki.
