### Highlights

> Link Shell Extension (LSE) provides for the creation of[Hardlinks](#hardlinks), [Junctions](#junctions),[Volume Mountpoints](#volumemountpoint), and [Symbolic Links](#symboliclinks), (herein referred to collectively as Links) a folder [cloning process](#hardlinkclones) that utilises Hardlinks or Symbolic Links and a copy process taking care of Junctions, Symbolic Links, and Hardlinks. LSE, as its name implies is implemented as a Shell extension and is accessed from Windows Explorer, or similar file/folder managers.
