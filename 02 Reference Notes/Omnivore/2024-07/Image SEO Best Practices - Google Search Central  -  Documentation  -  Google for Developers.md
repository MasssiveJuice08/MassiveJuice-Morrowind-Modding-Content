### Highlights

> Likewise, the filename can give Google very light clues about the subject matter of the image. When possible, use filenames that are short, but descriptive. For example,`my-new-black-kitten.jpg` is better than `IMG00023.JPG`.

> If your site has thousands of images, you might want to consider automating the naming of the images. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-developers-google-com-search-docs-appearance-google-images-19096daf7e7#c56172fe-a51b-44f5-b4af-fec54e3cf0dc)  ^c56172fe
