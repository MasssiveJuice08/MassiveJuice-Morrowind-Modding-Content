The border-image property allows drawing on image around another as a border - perhaps useful for the Morrowind Modding Wiki

_This page is powered by [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app) ‐ you can read more about how I use Omnivore here: [[Omnivore - Saving Articles for Citations in Obsidian]]._

### Highlights

> The border-imageCSS property draws an image around a given element. It replaces the element's regular border. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/border-image-css-cascading-style-sheets-mdn-18ee15ee84c#30361dd5-8d71-46e2-82a3-57458424c107)  ^30361dd5

Use this to create a custom Morrowind theme for the MMW Quartz site.
