### Highlights

> The Dissident Priests do not reject mysticism, revelation, or prophecy as part of the religious experience. The Dissidents have not resolved the issue of true or false insights. They have studied the mysticism of the Ashlander Ancestor Cults, in particular the rites of the Ashlander seers and wise women, and the prophecies of the Incarnate. Many among the Dissident Priests have come to believe that the Nerevarine prophecies are genuine [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/morrowind-progress-of-truth-the-unofficial-elder-scrolls-pages-u-18f2e040c86#a5cf6b1e-8bd1-43ad-bcfa-af69ccde0a79)  ^a5cf6b1e

Mysticism of the Ashlander Ancestor Cults. Tie it into the Nerevarine? Or the previous failed Incarnates?
