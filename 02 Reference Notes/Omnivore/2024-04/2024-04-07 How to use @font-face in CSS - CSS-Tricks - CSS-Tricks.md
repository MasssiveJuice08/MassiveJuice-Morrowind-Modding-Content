## Highlights

> The `@font-face` rule allows custom fonts to be loaded on a webpage. Once added to a stylesheet, the rule instructs the browser to download the font from where it is hosted, then display it as specified in the CSS.
> 
> Without the rule, our designs are limited to the fonts that are already loaded on a user’s computer, which vary depending on the system being used. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-css-tricks-com-snippets-css-using-font-face-in-css-18eb82d077c#61323848-9724-4a13-9ee8-531bbd9508db)  ^61323848

Use `@font-face` CSS rule to add custom fonts like OpenMW's 'Mystic Cards' to Obsidian and Quartz.
