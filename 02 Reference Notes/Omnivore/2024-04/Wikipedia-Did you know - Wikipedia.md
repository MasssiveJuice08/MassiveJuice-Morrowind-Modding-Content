### Highlights

> DYK showcases new and improved content by presenting a series of facts ("hooks"), some of them accompanied by images, which link to selected articles. The hooks appear for a limited period in the "Did you know...?" box on the Main Page. Editors whose articles appear in DYK will receive an acknowledgement on their user talk pages. The choice of articles is subject to a series of criteria (see [DYK rules](#DYK%5Frules) below). Editors may [nominate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:DYKNOM "Wikipedia:DYKNOM") their own or someone else's work for a DYK appearance.

Wikipedia _'Did you know'_ section is a 'hook' to direct users to new and improved content. It supplements _'Today's Featured Article'_. Could be implemented as a community engagement showcase on #MMW
