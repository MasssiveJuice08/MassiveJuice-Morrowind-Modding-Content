### Highlights

> This plugin automatically converts single line breaks in Markdown text into hard line breaks in the HTML output. This plugin is not enabled by default as this doesn’t follow the semantics of actual Markdown but you may enable it if you’d like parity with [Obsidian](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/Obsidian-compatibility).

Investigate this for MMW. Enabling this may make editing between Obsidian and Quartz more seamless.
