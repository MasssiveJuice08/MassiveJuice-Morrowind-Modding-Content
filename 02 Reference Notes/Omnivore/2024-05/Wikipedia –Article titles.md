A Wikipedia article defining naming conventions for article titles – Article titles should be recognizable, concise, natural, precise, and consistent.

_This page is powered by [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app) ‐ you can read more about how I use Omnivore here: [[Omnivore - Saving Articles for Citations in Obsidian]]._

### Highlights

> **This page in a nutshell:** Article titles should be recognizable, concise, natural, precise, and consistent. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-en-m-wikipedia-org-wiki-wikipedia-article-titles-18fbe913eb4#018aa782-6494-4833-9262-a07b7d109de6)  ^018aa782

> Generally, article titles are based on what the subject is called in [reliable sources](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOURCES "Wikipedia:SOURCES"). When this offers multiple possibilities, editors choose among them by considering [several principles](#Deciding%5Fon%5Fan%5Farticle%5Ftitle): the ideal article title precisely identifies the subject; it is short, natural, distinguishable and recognizable; and resembles titles for similar articles.
