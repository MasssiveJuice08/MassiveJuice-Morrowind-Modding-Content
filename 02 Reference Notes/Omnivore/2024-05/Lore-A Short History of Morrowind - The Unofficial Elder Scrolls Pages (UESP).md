In the decades after reorganization, [Balmora](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Balmora "Lore:Balmora") and the [Ascadian Isles](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ascadian%5FIsles "Lore:Ascadian Isles") regions have grown steadily. [Caldera](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Caldera "Lore:Caldera") and [Pelagiad](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Pelagiad "Lore:Pelagiad") are completely new settlements, and all legion forts were expanded to accommodate larger garrisons.
