## On Discovering Morrowind

This is my first diorama, a birthday present for my older sister. We discovered Morrowind back in 2005 when my friend bought me a copy for my tenth birthday (one of the Big Bytes collections games). I was a bit too young and lacked the patience and skill to understand the game's mechanics, so I mostly ran around as a level one khajiit, getting shanked by shady mudcrabs.

My sister is a few years older though, and to me it seemed like she mastered the game. Most of my memories of Morrowind's quests and story were experienced vicariously, watching her play as a Telvanni Mage – always playing as a Breton because their magicka resistance meant they could wear the [Boots of Blinding Speed](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Boots_of_Blinding_Speed) without being blinded. I loved hearing her tell me about the Thieves Guild storyline and their clandestine conflict with the Fighters Guild. I watched her be named 'Hortator' and defeat Dagoth Ur beneath Red Mountain. 

She kicked ass.

Though I did not master the game's mechanics at the time, it left a strong impression on me. The contrast of familiar medieval fantasy tropes, of picturesque Pelagiad and Imperial Legionnaires, against the alien, the esoteric and the bizarre of Vvardenfell – these were captivating yet wrapped in mystery made more elusive by my lack of understanding of the mechanics of the world.
